# Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

• Lab 7 Part 1:
    This is my absolute favorite lab, I enjoyed this lab a lot, it helped me learn the difference of when to use and / or, and the importance of using the correct one. We also used a lot of if statements which is always super fun to me and something I enjoy in all the labs that we do.

• Lab 8 Part 1:
    This was a fun lab, I enjoyed using nested “for” loops and such. I also enjoyed the fact that even though we were working on multiple files it didn’t feel like I was the next Einstein learning how to use for and for each.

• Lab 4 Part 2:
    This was my second favorite lab because considering it was still so early in the semester, making a guessing game felt like I had just done rocket science. I also learned the importance of checking your work and making sure it passes the tests after this lab. Another thing I enjoyed was that it was easy enough that I didn’t feel dumb or nervous to start but hard enough it still challenged my brain on how I should do it.
